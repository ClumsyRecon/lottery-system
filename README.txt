This is my final project which is a lottery system created using PHP and JavaScript, as an Admin you can create lotteries for Members to purchaces tickets for and you can view winners of previous lotteries.
Members are able to view current lotteries and buy tickets, and they can also view tickets which they have bough to lotteries.

Admin Login
Email: test@test.com
Password: test
To create a new admin account, you must go into the database and change the usertype for a user to admin inorder to make them an admin.

The Admin can create new lotteries by clicking on the red plus button at the bottom of the admin page, it will bring up a modal form for lottery information to be entered.
Once the lottery has been created the admin can then generate numbers for the lottery by clicking the Generate Numbers button which will then load random numbers for the given lottery.
A user can then register by entering their details into the form and upon registration they will be logged in and able to view the lotteries and buy tickets for each one.
To buy a ticket a user must select a lottery and then they will be taken to a form where they must select six (6) numbers from 1 to 60 to be on their ticket, once they have selected six (6) they can buy the ticket.
After buying a ticket they will proceed to the tickets page where it shows the user all the tickets which they own for each lottery, it also provides the option for the user to buy another ticket for the lottery.
When an existing user returns to the site, the site will store the last email that logged in into the login form so the user only needs to enter their password to login again.

There are a few known bugs at the moment which will be fixed in the future, such bugs are:
1.Users are able to see and buy tickets for lotteries which have already been drawn.
2.Numbers need to be manually generated by the admin, in the future it will draw the numbers on the draw date.
